# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

The SVG Logo Maker is a unique tool to create a simple logo with basic shapes and some text. It can definitely be used for a simple professional project or even a placeholder, but mostly it's just for fun. 
This project helped me learn a lot about organization of files and master the ability to import and export from different folders/files.
